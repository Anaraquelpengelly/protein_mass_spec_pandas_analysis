# protein_mass_spec_pandas_analysis

Analysis of protein interactions by protein mass-spectrometry from a table generated by MaxQuant and Perseus.
This script was used to select interactors of protein x that follow certain selection criteria: 
1-Experiment value > 3 (which indicates that the IBAQ is robust)
2-PEP value < 10E-5 (which indicates that the identification is robust)
